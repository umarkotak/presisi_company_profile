            Presisi adopts a customer-focused culture. We bend-over-backwards to make sure our facilities exceed our customers’ needs and expectations. Part of the process of providing a high-quality building for our customers is by listening to their needs.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            When developing a new facility for our customers, our experienced team collaborate with our clients from the sourcing of the land through the construction, and ultimately the handover of the building. Our Build-to-Suit development service allow our customers to have a customized building that meet their specific requirements down to the last detail. In the process of designing the premise, our customers can rely on our high level of attentiveness to build an efficient, fully-optimized, and personalized warehouse facility. We then obtain a planning and building permission prior to the actual construction, and deliver the finished premise according to the strict budget and schedule.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            In addition to our Build-to-Suit development service, we also offer readily-available storage facilities in prime locations throughout Indonesia.

            According to a British real estate tycoon, Lord Harold Samuel, the three most important factors in buying a property are location, location, location.
